### What I Learned

- Improved my understanding of javascript functionality and creating custom inputs
- Gained experience with JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation for dynamic generation.
- Better understanding of using proper semantic html elements.

### Continued Development

I plan to enhance this project with additional features, including:

- Replace alert message with custom modal popup.
